## Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

        git clone https://github.com/LinoVives16/bildy-api.git
        cd bildy-api
        npm install

2. Set up environment variables:

        cp .env.example .env

   Fill in the variables in `.env` (see Environment Variables section).

3. Start the server:

        npm run dev    # development (auto-restart on changes)

## Running with Docker

Start the app together with MongoDB in one command:

        docker compose up --build

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Server port (default 3000) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment (`development` / `test` / `production`) |
| `MONGO_URL` | MongoDB connection URI |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for signing JWTs |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Access token duration (e.g. `15m`) |
| `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN` | Refresh token duration (e.g. `7d`) |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Cloudinary cloud name |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` | Cloudinary API key |
| `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | Cloudinary API secret |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK` | Slack Incoming Webhook URL |
| `MAIL_HOST` | SMTP host (e.g. `sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io`) |
| `MAIL_PORT` | SMTP port (e.g. `2525`) |
| `MAIL_USER` | SMTP username |
| `MAIL_PASS` | SMTP password |

## Running Tests

        npm test              # run all tests
        npm run test:watch    # watch mode
        npm run test:coverage # with coverage report

Tests use `mongodb-memory-server` (in-memory database) and do not require a real MongoDB connection or any external services.

Current coverage: **~87% statements / ~88% lines** (129+ tests).

## Swagger Docs

With the server running, access the interactive UI at:

        http://localhost:3000/api-docs

## Health Check

        GET /health

Returns server status, MongoDB connection state and process uptime.

## Real-time Events (Socket.IO)

The server emits WebSocket events so connected clients receive updates instantly without polling.

**Connecting:**

```js
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000', {
  auth: { token: '<your JWT access token>' }
});
```

The connection requires a valid JWT token. Each client is automatically joined to a room identified by their `company._id`, so events are only received by users of the same company.

**Events:**

| Event | Triggered when |
|-------|----------------|
| `client:new` | A new client is created |
| `project:new` | A new project is created |
| `deliverynote:new` | A new delivery note is created |
| `deliverynote:signed` | A delivery note is signed |

**Example:**

```js
socket.on('deliverynote:signed', (data) => {
  console.log('Delivery note signed:', data);
});
```

## Testing with api.http

The `api.http` file includes examples for all endpoints with variables that capture tokens automatically.

1. Run `Register` — the verification code is sent to the configured email.
2. Paste the code into `Validation`.
3. Run `Login` — updates `{{login_token}}` and `{{refresh_token}}` automatically.
4. All subsequent requests use the saved tokens without manual copying.
